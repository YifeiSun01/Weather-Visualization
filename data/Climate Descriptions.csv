3,BWh,Hot desert climate,"The precipitation threshold (in millimetres) involves first multiplying the average annual temperature in ¡ãC by 20, then adding 280 if 70% or more of the total precipitation is in the high-sun summer half of the year (April through September in the Northern Hemisphere, or October through March in the Southern), or 140 if 30¨C70% of the total precipitation is received during the applicable period, or 0 if less than 30% of the total precipitation is so received there. If the area's annual precipitation is less than half the threshold (50%), it is classified as a BW (desert climate), while 50-100% the threshold results in a semi-arid climate. above the following isotherm most commonly a mean annual temperature of 18 ¡ãC (64.4 ¡ãF), or sometimes the coldest month's mean temperature of 0 or ?3 ¡ãC (32.0 or 26.5 ¡ãF)"
